## Hey, I'm Nicole! 👩🏻‍💻  (she/her)

* 👩🏻‍🎓 Last year I completed my PhD in [Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (BCB)](https://bcb.unc.edu) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 
* 🖥 I work in the [Phanstiel Lab](http://phanstiel-lab.med.unc.edu/) developing tools and workflows to visualize and analyze genomic data, and I am currently applying these tools to perform response expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping to investigate the genomic loci associated with osteoarthritis.  
* 📈 I love working with data of any kind, making beautiful data visualizations, and solving code-based problems!

* 📜 [Publication](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/38/7/2042/6522111)
* 📖 [Documentation](https://phanstiellab.github.io/plotgardener/)
* Back during development under a different name, I gave a talk on the principles of the software at rstudio::global(2021) that you can check out [here](https://posit.co/resources/videos/a-new-paradigm-for-multifigure-coordinate-based-plotting-in-r/)! 
* I am always looking to improve and expand `plotgardener`, so be sure to leave any suggestions in the [issues](https://github.com/PhanstielLab/plotgardener/issues).
